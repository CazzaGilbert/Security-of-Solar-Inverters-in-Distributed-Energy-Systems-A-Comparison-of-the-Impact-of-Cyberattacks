# Security-of-Solar-Inverters-in-Distributed-Energy-Systems-A-Comparison-of-the-Impact-of-Cyberattacks
As the push for green energy continues solar panels and intelligent inverters are becoming increasingly popular with homeowners as a way to produce their electricity while also contributing to grid stability. One of the biggest features of the intelligence behind these inverters is their ability to provide flawless integration with the electrical grid through the use of data analysis, advanced algorithms and performance optimisation only possible through the use of IoT-based monitoring. Of concern is that the cyber component of these inverters is not heavily secured which can allow adversaries to take control of the inverters and therefore have control over the flow of electricity in Australia. Having control over Australiaâ€™s electricity could allow adversaries to do targeted attacks through power outages and/or infrastructure damages.
